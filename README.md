# Nike React - Online Clothing Shop

This is an online clothing shop built using React, Redux, Firebase, React-Router, Bootstrap, CSS, functional and class components. The shop features all clothing categories with a price filter, allowing users to easily find the products they're looking for. The shop is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. They can create a customer account to save their favorite products, keep track of their orders, and view their purchase history. 

Users can browse through the different clothing categories, such as T-shirts, sweaters, pants, and more, and filter their search by price to find the perfect item.
